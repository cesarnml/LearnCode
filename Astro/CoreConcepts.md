## Why Astro

- [[Astro]] is an `all-in-one web framework` for building `fast, content-focused websites`
- Five core design principles behind Astro:
  1. [[Content-focused]]
  2. [[Sever-first]]
  3. [[Fast by default]]
  4. [[Easy to use]]
  5. [[Fully-featured, but flexible]]

### [[Content-focused]]

- Good for content-rich websites:
  - marketing sites
  - publishing sites
  - documentation sites
  - blogs
  - portfolios
  - _some_ ecommerce sites
- Not a great fit for _web-apps_

### [[Server-first]]

- Leverages server-side rendering over client-side rendering as much as possible

### [[Fast by default]]

- _It should be nearly impossible to build a slow website with Astro_

### [[Easy to use]]

- Astro components are renderer only on the server. There is no reactivity!

### [[Fully-featured, but flexible]]

- Includes:
  - component syntax (`.astro`)
  - file-based routing
  - asset handing
  - a build process
  - bundling
  - optimizations
  - data-fetching
- Awesome integrations (such as React, Tailwind CSS, MDX, image optimizations, and deployment to popular host providers)
